This is a collection of all FBS and (eventually) all FCS teams logos. I made it for me, but I needed an easier way to store and access them than constantly plugging in an external hard drive.

I spent about 3 months going through every school's brand guidelines, art sheets, logo sheets, brand identities, etc. in order to get the most up-to-date logos. All logos should be in the correct school colors, with a transparent background, and in a 500x500 frame. If there are any mistakes (wrong logo, wrong colors, etc.) please let me know.

More logos will be added when I get around to it. Or if anyone ever sees it, I'll make it more of a priority.

For reference (since I don't know how right now, or think it's a big deal), this is a quick guide to decoding, and pulling the right logos quicker.

Logos are tagged by type, series order, and size.

The first letter is the type (p=primary, s=secondary, w=wordmark, m=mascot, conf=conference, figure out the rest on your own).

The number following the type represents either the order they are listed by the university, or whatever I felt goes best.
